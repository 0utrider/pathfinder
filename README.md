# Outrider's Pathfinder Projects

A collection of small, focused tools for Pathfinder 2e and Starfinder 2e.  
Each tool is self‑contained so GMs and players can clone only what they need.

## About This Repository

This repo is structured so each tool lives in its own folder with its own assets, styles, and documentation.  
The root directory contains only shared branding (like the logo) and this landing page.

If you want to clone just a single tool, simply copy its folder into your own project — no parent‑level dependencies required.
