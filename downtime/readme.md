# 🧮 Downtime Calculator
A fast, friendly Pathfinder 2e & Starfinder 2e downtime calculator for Organized Play.  
Because math is hard and you have better things to do between sessions.

**Live version:**  
https://0utrider.github.io/pathfinder/downtime/index.html

---

## ✨ What It Does
- Calculates downtime income for **PF2** and **SF2**
- Handles proficiency, results, HHST Boon, and system‑specific EL rules
- Loads DC & income values from CSV (so you can tweak or homebrew without touching the code)
- Supports up to **7 characters** at once
- Generates a clean, ready‑to‑paste **summary**
- Includes a **Copy to Clipboard** button (your wrists will thank you)

---

## 📚 Appendix
The built‑in Appendix includes:
- **Acronyms** (because Organized Play loves them)
- **Glossary** (quick definitions for new players or sleepy GMs)
- **Full Downtime Income Table** (PF2 or SF2 depending on your toggle)
